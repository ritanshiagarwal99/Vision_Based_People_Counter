<h1>Vision Based People Counter</h1>
<h2>Detailed Implementation using OpenCV and MotPy in Python3</h2>
<p>Vision based people counter has several remarkable applications like Security & Survillence, Crowd Monitoring, and sales forcasting of a certain store as well. 
This can be achieved by performing face detection and tracking algorithm.For this purpose, OpenCV and MotPy has been used in this project. 
</p>
1. Firstly, We need to install some libraries for our python code to run.<br><br>
1.1. Install OpenCV Contrib library using pip (We can install just OpenCV also, but it limits itself in some functions)
<pre><code>pip install opencv-contrib-python
</code></pre>
1.2. Install motpy using pip (It contains the tracking algorithm)
<pre><code>pip install motpy
</code></pre>
<br>
2. <b>Optional: </b>Attach a USB webcam to your device. (Otherwise, the script will use default webcam of your laptop.)<br><br>
3. Run the face_track.py<br><br>
4. Press 'p' to terminate the program.<br>
